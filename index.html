                        I'm Zuzana. I enjoy warm weather and that probably sums up 
                        the reason why I moved from San Francisco early 2018 to be 
                        in San Diego. Best decision of my life. 
                        <br> <br>
                        â€‹In San Francisco I got my BFA in Film/Directing and pursued 
                        a Creative Director career. I've directed numerous videos 
                        for clients getting their product started on Kickstarter or 
                        Indiegogo. 
                        <br>
                        Having moved to San Diego I used my directorial skills to 
                        become a Project Manager in Digital Marketing - which has 
                        opened up several more doors into me contributing to Social 
                        Media, Website Editing, Product Photography and more.
                        <br>
                        I am a well rounded, creative, organized individual 
                        with a great work ethic willing to take on new challenges 
                        and excel at former ones.
